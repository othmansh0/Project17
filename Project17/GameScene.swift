//advanceSimulationTime()
//most of the screen wouldn't start with particles and they would just stream in from the right. But by using the advanceSimulationTime() method of the emitter weâ€™re going to ask SpriteKit to simulate 10 seconds passing in the emitter, thus updating all the particles as if they were created 10 seconds ago
